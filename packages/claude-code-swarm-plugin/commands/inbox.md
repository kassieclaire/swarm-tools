# /swarm:inbox

Review Swarm Mail without blowing context.

## Native integration
When agent teams are active (via Teammate tool), native messaging handles real-time DMs automatically.
`swarmmail_inbox()` shows persistent message history and non-team coordination.

## Workflow
1. `swarmmail_inbox()` for headers (max 5).
2. Review message content directly from inbox output.
3. Use `swarmmail_send()` to reply if needed.

## Usage
`/swarm:inbox`
