/**
 * Swarm-Aware Compaction Hook
 *
 * Provides context preservation during OpenCode session compaction.
 * When context is compacted, this hook injects instructions for the summarizer
 * to preserve swarm coordination state and enable seamless resumption.
 *
 * Hook signature (from @opencode-ai/plugin):
 * ```typescript
 * "experimental.session.compacting"?: (
 *   input: { sessionID: string },
 *   output: { context: string[] }
 * ) => Promise<void>
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { SWARM_COMPACTION_CONTEXT, createCompactionHook } from "opencode-swarm-plugin";
 *
 * const hooks: Hooks = {
 *   "experimental.session.compacting": createCompactionHook(),
 * };
 * ```

/**
 * Swarm-aware compaction context

 * Injected during compaction to keep the swarm cooking. The coordinator should

 * This is NOT about preserving state for a human - it's about the swarm continuing
 * autonomously after context compression.

export const SWARM_COMPACTION_CONTEXT = `## 🐝 SWARM ACTIVE - Keep Cooking

You are the **COORDINATOR** of an active swarm. Context was compacted but the swarm is still running.

**YOUR JOB:** Keep orchestrating. Spawn agents. Monitor progress. Unblock work. Ship it.

### Preserve in Summary

Extract from session context:

1. **Epic & Subtasks** - IDs, titles, status, file assignments
2. **What's Running** - Which agents are active, what they're working on  
3. **What's Blocked** - Blockers and what's needed to unblock
4. **What's Done** - Completed work and any follow-ups needed
5. **What's Next** - Pending subtasks ready to spawn

### Summary Format

\`\`\`
## 🐝 Swarm State

**Epic:** <bd-xxx> - <title>
**Project:** <path>
**Progress:** X/Y subtasks complete

**Active:**
- <bd-xxx>: <title> [in_progress] → <agent> working on <files>

**Blocked:**
- <bd-xxx>: <title> - BLOCKED: <reason>

**Completed:**
- <bd-xxx>: <title> ✓

**Ready to Spawn:**
- <bd-xxx>: <title> (files: <...>)
\`\`\`

### On Resume - IMMEDIATELY

1. \`swarm_status(epic_id="<epic>", project_key="<path>")\` - Get current state
2. \`swarmmail_inbox(limit=5)\` - Check for agent messages
3. **Spawn ready subtasks** - Don't wait, fire them off
4. **Unblock blocked work** - Resolve dependencies, reassign if needed
5. **Collect completed work** - Close done subtasks, verify quality

### Keep the Swarm Cooking

- **Spawn aggressively** - If a subtask is ready and unblocked, spawn an agent
- **Monitor actively** - Check status, read messages, respond to blockers
- **Close the loop** - When all subtasks done, verify and close the epic
- **Don't stop** - The swarm runs until the epic is closed

**You are not waiting for instructions. You are the coordinator. Coordinate.**
