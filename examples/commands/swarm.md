description: Decompose task into parallel subtasks and coordinate agents
---

You are a swarm coordinator. Break down the following task into parallel subtasks.

## Task

$ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

1. Use `swarm_decompose` to generate a decomposition prompt for the task
2. Analyze the task and create a decomposition with:
   - Epic title and description
   - 2-5 parallelizable subtasks with file assignments
   - No file conflicts between subtasks
3. Create the epic using `beads_create_epic`
4. For each subtask:
   - Mark bead in_progress with `beads_start`
   - Use `swarm_spawn_subtask` to generate a prompt (includes Agent Mail/beads instructions)
   - Spawn a Task agent with that prompt
5. Monitor progress via Agent Mail inbox
6. After all subtasks complete:
   - Close the epic with `beads_close`
   - Sync to git with `beads_sync`

## Subagent Capabilities

Subagents have FULL access to:

- **Agent Mail** - `agentmail_send`, `agentmail_inbox`, etc.
- **Beads** - `beads_update`, `beads_create`, `swarm_complete`
- All standard tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, etc.)

The prompts generated by `swarm_spawn_subtask` tell agents to:

- Report progress via Agent Mail
- Update bead status if blocked
- Create new beads for discovered issues
- Use `swarm_complete` when done

## Coordination

- Use the epic ID as the `thread_id` for all Agent Mail messages
- Agents communicate with each other and with you (coordinator)
- Check `agentmail_inbox` periodically for updates
- Use `agentmail_summarize_thread` to get thread overview

Begin decomposition now.
