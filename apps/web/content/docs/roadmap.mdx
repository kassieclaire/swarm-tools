# Roadmap

Future plans for Swarm Tools. Organized by package and priority.

## Current Status (v0.1.x)

**What exists today:**
- swarm-mail package (event sourcing, projections, durable primitives)
- opencode-swarm-plugin (beads, swarm orchestration, learning, skills)
- PGLite-based storage (local-first, no external servers)
- Pattern maturity tracking with confidence decay
- Anti-pattern detection and inversion

**What works:**
- Multi-agent task decomposition with file reservations
- Event-sourced coordination with full audit trail
- Durable primitives (mailbox, lock, cursor, deferred)
- Skills system with bundled domain expertise
- Learning from decomposition outcomes

---

## Near-Term (v0.2 - Q1 2025)

### Performance Optimizations

**Problem:** Polling-based inbox checking wastes CPU and adds latency.

**Solution:** Live queries with PGLite's `LISTEN/NOTIFY` support.

**Impact:**
- Notification latency: 500ms → ~10ms (50x faster)
- CPU usage: 5-10% → ~1% (5-10x reduction)
- Zero polling queries in idle state

**Deliverables:**
- `watchInbox()` - Live inbox updates
- `watchEvents()` - Live event stream
- Batch message send API
- Batch event append API

---

### Message Queue Features

**Problem:** No priority handling, no dead-letter queue, no TTL cleanup.

**Solution:** Priority queues (4 levels), DLQ with retry tracking, TTL with background cleanup.

**Impact:**
- Critical messages processed first (priority 0 = urgent)
- Failed messages retry 3x before DLQ
- Expired messages cleaned up automatically

**Deliverables:**
- Priority column in messages table
- `failed_messages` table with retry logic
- `expires_at` column with background cleanup job
- Pub/sub with wildcard topic subscriptions

---

## Mid-Term (v0.3-v0.4 - Q2 2025)

### DevTools + CLI

**Problem:** No visibility into swarm coordination, debugging is manual.

**Solution:** CLI + embeddable SvelteKit UI for observability.

**Deliverables:**
- CLI: `swarm events`, `swarm messages`, `swarm locks`, `swarm replay`
- DevTools UI: event stream viewer, message inbox/outbox, file reservation timeline
- Real-time updates via SSE
- Static export (works offline)

**Example:**

```bash
# Tail events in real-time
swarm events --tail

# Replay event stream from specific point
swarm replay --from 1234

# View file locks
swarm locks
```

---

### Metrics + Tracing

**Problem:** No production monitoring, no distributed tracing.

**Solution:** Prometheus metrics + OpenTelemetry tracing.

**Deliverables:**
- `/metrics` endpoint with Prometheus format
- Message send/receive latency histogram
- Lock contention histogram
- Queue depth gauge
- OpenTelemetry spans for message flows
- Trace context propagation across agents
- Grafana dashboard template
- Jaeger/Zipkin integration guide

---

## Long-Term (v1.0+ - Q3 2025 and beyond)

### Saga Pattern

**Problem:** Long-running multi-agent workflows need orchestration and compensation (undo).

**Solution:** Saga coordinator with compensation pattern.

**Deliverables:**
- `saga_instances` and `saga_steps` tables
- Saga orchestration pattern
- Compensation (undo) support for failed steps
- Saga viewer in DevTools UI
- 3+ example saga workflows

**Example:**

```typescript
const saga = Saga.create('user-onboarding')
  .step('create-account', createAccount, undoCreateAccount)
  .step('send-email', sendWelcomeEmail, undoSendEmail)
  .step('setup-profile', setupProfile, undoSetupProfile)
  .execute();
```

---

### Additional Standalone Packages

**Potential future packages:**

| Package | Purpose | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `@swarmtools/vector` | Embeddings, vector storage for semantic search | Planned |
| `@swarmtools/learning` | Pattern maturity, anti-pattern detection (extracted) | Planned |
| `@swarmtools/skills` | Knowledge injection, SKILL.md format (extracted) | Planned |
| `@swarmtools/structured` | Schema validation, JSON extraction (extracted) | Planned |
| `@swarmtools/guardrails` | Rate limiting, output guards (extracted) | Planned |

**Why extract?** Each package solves one problem well. Users can mix and match what they need without pulling in the entire plugin.

---

## Experimental Ideas (No ETA)

### Auto-Healing Swarms

Agents detect and recover from blockers autonomously without coordinator intervention.

**Example:** Agent A is blocked on schema from Agent B. Agent A automatically sends a high-priority request to Agent B and waits for response.

---

### Semantic Code Search

Vector-based codebase exploration for decomposition context. Query CASS + codebase embeddings for relevant files.

**Example:** "Find all authentication-related files" returns ranked results based on semantic similarity.

---

### Prevention Pipeline Integration

Auto-generate prevention patterns from debug sessions. Store in semantic memory and apply to future swarms.

**Example:** After debugging "headers already sent" error, create UBS scanner rule and store prevention pattern for future decompositions.

---

### Multi-Project Coordination

Cross-repo dependencies and shared context. Swarms coordinate across monorepo boundaries.

**Example:** Frontend swarm waits for backend API schema swarm to complete before implementing client.

---

### Learning Export/Import

Share pattern maturity across teams. Export learning data as JSON, import into other projects.

**Example:** Team A's proven decomposition strategies become Team B's starting point.

## Community-Driven

**Want a feature?** Open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/joelhooks/opencode-swarm-plugin).

**Want to contribute?** We welcome PRs for:
- New bundled skills
- Custom database adapters
- Performance improvements
- Documentation enhancements

---

## Release Philosophy

**Incremental value.** Each release delivers a complete feature that solves a real problem.

**Backward compatibility.** Breaking changes only in major versions.

**Performance first.** Optimizations come before new features.

**Local-first.** No external dependencies or cloud services required.
