# Quickstart

Get multi-agent coordination running in your project in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ or Bun
- OpenCode CLI installed
- A git repository

## Install the Plugin

```bash
npm install -g opencode-swarm-plugin@latest
```

Or with Bun:

```bash
bun add -g opencode-swarm-plugin@latest
```

## Setup

Run the setup wizard:

```bash
swarm setup
```

This will:
1. Check for required dependencies (beads CLI)
2. Configure OpenCode to load the plugin
3. Initialize beads in your project (if not already)
4. Verify everything works

## Verify Installation

```bash
swarm doctor
```

Expected output:
```
✓ Beads CLI installed
✓ OpenCode plugin configured
✓ Beads initialized in project
✓ All systems ready
```

## Your First Swarm

In OpenCode, run:

```
/swarm "Add a health check endpoint at /api/health"
```

The plugin will:
1. Analyze the task
2. Decompose into subtasks (if needed)
3. Create beads for tracking
4. Spawn worker agents
5. Coordinate file reservations
6. Report completion

## Manual Workflow

If you prefer step-by-step control:

```typescript
// 1. Check what's ready to work on
beads_ready()

// 2. Start a task
beads_start({ id: "bd-123" })

// 3. Initialize coordination (for multi-agent work)
swarmmail_init({ project_path: "/your/project" })

// 4. Reserve files before editing
swarmmail_reserve({
  paths: ["src/api/**"],
  reason: "bd-123: Health endpoint"
})

// 5. Do your work...

// 6. Complete the task
swarm_complete({
  project_key: "/your/project",
  agent_name: "YourAgent",
  bead_id: "bd-123",
  summary: "Added /api/health endpoint",
  files_touched: ["src/api/health.ts"]
})

// 7. Sync to git (MANDATORY)
beads_sync()
```

## Using Skills

Load domain expertise into your context:

```typescript
// List available skills
skills_list()

// Load a skill for your current task
skills_use({ name: "testing-patterns" })
```

Bundled skills include:
- **testing-patterns** - Dependency breaking, characterization tests
- **swarm-coordination** - Multi-agent orchestration
- **cli-builder** - Building command-line tools
- **system-design** - Architecture decisions

## Key Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `swarm setup` | Initial configuration |
| `swarm doctor` | Check dependencies |
| `swarm init` | Initialize beads in project |
| `swarm config` | Show config paths |

## Key Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `beads_ready()` | Get next unblocked task |
| `beads_sync()` | Sync to git (MANDATORY at session end) |
| `swarmmail_init()` | Initialize coordination |
| `swarmmail_reserve()` | Reserve files for editing |
| `swarm_complete()` | Complete task with cleanup |
| `skills_use()` | Load domain expertise |

## What's Next

- [OpenCode Plugin Reference](/docs/opencode-plugin) - All 40+ tools documented
- [Philosophy](/docs/philosophy) - Design principles and mental models
- [Patterns](/docs/patterns) - Coordination patterns and best practices
- [Swarm Mail Architecture](/docs/swarm-mail) - Event sourcing deep dive

## Troubleshooting

**"beads not found"**
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steveyegge/beads/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

**"swarmmail_init failed"**
- Ensure you're in a git repository
- Check that `.opencode/` directory is writable

**"Plugin not loading"**
```bash
swarm setup  # Re-run setup
swarm doctor # Check what's missing
```

## Session Checklist

Every session should:

1. **Start**: `beads_ready()` - What's next?
2. **Work**: Use tools, reserve files, communicate
3. **End**: `beads_sync()` + `git push` - Land the plane

The plane is not landed until `git push` succeeds.
